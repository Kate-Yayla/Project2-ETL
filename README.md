# **Project 2 - Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)**

In an effort to demonstrate our skills acquired thus far, in a real-world-esque scenario, we embarked on a project to extract data from sources, tranform it by cleaning and/or reformatting, and loading or storing the resulting data into a well designed database.  This is a key process for any company utilizing data to enhance decision-making.  This process of extraction, transformation, and loading is commonly referred to as "ETL".

## **Background**
---
YouTube is a popular platform for videos that people use for entertainment, education, workouts, and countless other reasons.  If a company is looking to market in North America and would like to understand trends in order to maximize their ad views, the database we developed could be helpful.
