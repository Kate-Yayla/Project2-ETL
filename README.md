# **Project 2 - Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)**

In an effort to demonstrate our skills acquired thus far, in a real-world-esque scenario, we embarked on a project to extract data from sources, tranform it by cleaning and/or reformatting, and loading or storing the resulting data into a well designed database.  
The team was made up of 5 actively participating students who aligned on the data set we were going to use on the 1st day the project was identified.  3 students created jupyter notebooks for Canada, US and mexico. The other 2 students foccussed on writing Querys and ERDs.

My focused was the CA jupyter notebook. 

This is a key process for any company utilizing data to enhance decision-making.  This process of extraction, transformation, and loading is commonly referred to as "ETL".

## **Background**

YouTube is a popular platform for videos that people use for entertainment, education, workouts, and countless other reasons.  If a company is looking to market in North America and would like to understand trends in order to maximize their ad views, the database we developed could be helpful.

## **Table of Contents**

- ETL Process
    - Extracted files from CSV into Data frames
    - dropped unnecessary columns
    - Stored json files in Data frames
    -   Extractig the data from the youtube video was more challenging than was expected as we ran into challenges when we tried to extract the json files and merge    
      on the categogory ID.
      - loaded the json file as data file
    - Make the id_list an integer to avoid issues when attempting merge
    - Merged on category id using left join
    - Check to see if there are any rows with missing data
    - Remove the rows with missing data
    - I had to rececreate my branch as i had a conflct when i attempted to merge the branch with the main
