# **Project 2 - Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)**

I
In an effort to demonstrate our skills acquired thus far, in a real-world-esque scenario, we embarked on a project to extract data from sources, tranform it by cleaning and/or reformatting, and loading or storing the resulting data into a well designed database.
The team was made up of 5 actively participating students who aligned on the data set we were going to use on the 1st day the project was identified. 3 students created jupyter notebooks for Canada, US and mexico. The other 2 students foccussed on writing Querys and ERDs.

My focused was the CA jupyter notebook.

This is a key process for any company utilizing data to enhance decision-making. This process of extraction, transformation, and loading is commonly referred to as "ETL".

## **Background**

YouTube is a popular platform for videos that people use for entertainment, education, workouts, and countless other reasons.  If a company is looking to market in North America and would like to understand trends in order to maximize their ad views, the database we developed could be helpful.  A part of the goal was to see which you tube videos were the highly viewed, liked, disliked.  The views would help to determine where marketing could place their ads to help promoto sales for their companies based on customers view prefrences
